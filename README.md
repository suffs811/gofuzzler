# Gofuzzler

Gofuzzler is the incredibly quick Golang implementation of Fuzzler (written in Python)

This tool:
1. crawls a webpage to return a list of words from it
2. finds the synonyms for each word to extend the wordlist
3. fuzzes the wordlist by changing case, prepending/appending digits and special characters, and more
